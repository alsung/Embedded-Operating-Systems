To run the shell: 

1. run the command: make
	- an executable named 'myshell' will be created
2. run the executable with command: ./myshell

3. to change directories, use command: cd <filename>

4. to exit the shell cleanly, use command: exit

Note: some commands may not have the permissions to be ran, 
including the command 'sudo' before the rest of the command
will usually solve this issue. 

Note: to stop the shell from reading from stdin, using Ctrl-D
